"""Writable TP broadcast buffers without changing community source files.

Torch's numpy/DLPack path cannot consume numpy's read-only view of pickle
bytes. Give only broadcast_pyobj a private numpy facade which copies such
views. Keep the community function body and distributed protocol unchanged.

The function object itself is retained: common's package re-export and any
earlier ``from ... import broadcast_pyobj`` aliases see the repair as well.
Each spawned interpreter installs its own bridge during normal bootstrap.
